Nand flash:
1. low cost
2. faster write and erase
3. No support Execution in place(XIP)
4. Recommended for Data storage

Nor Flash
1. comparitively more cost
2. slower write and erase 
3. supports XIP
4. Recommended for code storage

SRAM:

1. Faster as it doesnot require refresh.
2. Doesnot require refresh.
3. Occupies more space on-chip
4. Expensive
5. Size of SRAM is typically smaller compared to DRAM on embedded system

DRAM:

1. Slower because it needs refresh to retain data.
2. less expensive
3. requires refresh circuitry.
4. occupies less space on chip
5. Size of DRAM is typically greater compared to SRAM on embedded system
